Purpose: The two scripts demonstrate a basic network ping emulation where a client sends encoded data to a server, the server receives and unpack the data and returns a new packaged data to which the client receives and unpacks. Additionally, the client checks the round trip time from when the client sends and receives data to/from the server.  Moreover, the server is programmed to randomly ignore a return packet and as such the client handles this as a failed packet/time out, and calculates the statistics of packets sent and lost.
